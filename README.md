# Meditate

A Garmin Connect IQ meditation app that tracks as an activity the heart rate, stress, HRV and provides vibration alerts.

## Features
- ability to save the session as a Connect IQ activity (optional)
    - save as **Meditating** or **Yoga**
- ability to configure multiple meditation/yoga sessions
    - e.g. a 20 min session with 1 min recurring alerts, triggering a different alert on the 10th minute
    - each session supports interval vibration alerts
    - interval alerts can trigger from a few seconds up to few hours
- stress tracking
    - analyses in overlapping 10 Sec Windows Max-Min HR (reported as Max-Min HR 10 Sec Window chart on Connect IQ)
    - tracks the median of the Max-Min HR windows as a summary field (Stress Median field on Connect IQ)
    - calculates stress into 3 cathegories - **No**, **Low** and **High**
        - No - % of Max-Min Windows that are <= **stress median**
        - Low - % of Max-Min Windows that are > **stress median** and < 3x **stress median**
        - High - % of Max-Min Windows that are >= 3x **stress median**
- summary stats at the end of the session
    - tracks the overall min, avg and max HR
    - Stress
    - HRV
- [HRV](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart_rate_variability) (Heart Rate Variability) - optional
    - this approximates current HR to beat-to-beat intervals to calculate [Standard Deviation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_deviation) of the first and last 5 min of the session
    - the Vivoactive 3 HR sensor is too unreliable to produce usable intervals data for algorithms that analyse successive beat-to-beat intervals like RMSSD (it flattens the readings)
